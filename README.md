## 1. Favicon

Adding a favicon is essential for a more professional appearance and improves recognition in browser tabs.

## 2. Landing Page

The main issue here is that the background video is not fullscreen, which affects the visual effects negatively (for mobile especially). On mobile devices, the problem worsens due to the video being formatted in a landscape orientation. Additionally, the logo is an image instead of an SVG, which would ensure consistent high-quality rendering (svgs are not like images with which you get a set amout of pixels. A svg calculates every stroke so it is always high quality).

## 3. News Section

The news section is almost perfect, but there are two issues. Firstly, the header for this section and following sections should ideally follow a consistent placement, perhaps aligning them all to the same side for improved readability. Secondly, when viewed on larger screens, the text becomes unreadably small while the layout of images remains unchanged. Addressing this issue may require further adjustments to ensure better readability.

## 4. About Us Section

A simple fix for this section would be setting the width to 100vw (currently it is set to 90vw), ensuring it occupies the entire width of the screen.

## 5. Supervision Section

Inconsistency arises in the scaling of images within this section. It's advisable to manage each individual section with viewWidth or maintain the current setup and adjust the elements at the top accordingly.

## 6. Footer Section

The footer appears minimalistic and lacking interest. Adding social media links or similar elements like your Logo could enhance its appeal, though this is subjective and based on personal preference. The TikTok and Instagram handles for example could be shown there!
